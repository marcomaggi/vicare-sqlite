1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a distribution of C and Scheme libraries for
Vicare Scheme,  an R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation; it
provides bindings for the SQLite SQL database engine.

  The  last  time the  maintainer  bothered  to update  this
paragraph, he had tested SQLite Autoconf version 3.7.13.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.
