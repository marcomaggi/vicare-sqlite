# *NOTE*  If we  build  the  Slackware package  with  the "--linkadd  y"
# option,  the symbolic  links to  the  C shared  libraries are  created
# *after* this script is executed;  this means that the Scheme libraries
# will  not  find  shared  libraries  with correct  name  and  fail  the
# compilation after installation.
#
# We  will not  notice this  if  we are  upgrading the  package and  the
# symbolic links are already there from the old package.
