Subject: [announce] Vicare/SQLite revision 0.2d0

			     Vicare/SQLite
			     =============


This  package is a  distribution of  C and  Scheme libraries  for Vicare
Scheme, an R6RS compliant Scheme  implementation in the form of a native
compiler for x86 architectures, officially supporting GNU+Linux systems;
it provides bindings for the SQLite SQL database engine.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from Github:

	<https://sourceforge.net/projects/vicare-sqlite/files/>

the home page of the Vicare project is at:

               <http://marcomaggi.github.com/vicare.html>

development takes place at:

	     <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare-sqlite/>

  The last  time the author  bothered to  update this paragraph,  he had
tested SQLite Autoconf version 3.7.13.  The SQLite home page is at:

Notes for revision 0.2d0
------------------------

* Updated to and dependent on Vicare Scheme 0.3.


Notes for revision 0.1d2
------------------------

* No new code.

* The GNU  Autotools infrastructure has  been revised to  use Automake's
  parallel  test harness  and  adjust the  installation  path of  Scheme
  libraries to:

			$(libdir)/vicare-scheme


Notes for revision 0.1d1
------------------------

* Requires Vicare Scheme version 0.2d17.

* More functions have been interfaced.

* The data structures SQLITE3, SQLITE3-STMT  and SQLITE3-BLOB now hold a
  reference  to   an  application-supplied  destructor   function;  such
  functions  can be  used  to associate  any Scheme  value  to the  data
  structures.


Notes for revision 0.1d0
------------------------

* Requires Vicare Scheme version 0.2d15.

* Not all  the functions are interfaced,  but there should be  enough of
  them  to  play  with  something.   Not all  the  functions  have  been
  throughly tested.
